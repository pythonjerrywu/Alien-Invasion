# Alien-Invasion
Alien Invasion is a game where you control a spaceship with arrow keys and shoot with the space bar. You need to kill
groups of aliens that move towards the bottom of the screen. If an alien touches your spaceship or reaches the bottom,
you lose a life. The game gets more difficult as you progress.
