# Alien-Invasion
In the game Alien Invasion, players control a spaceship that initially appears in the center at the bottom of the screen. Players can use the arrow keys to move the spaceship left and right, and also use the space bar to shoot. At the beginning of the game, a group of aliens appeared in the sky and moved towards the bottom of the screen. The player's task is to shoot and kill these aliens. After the player has eliminated all the aliens, a new group of aliens will appear with faster movement speed. As long as an alien collides with the player's spaceship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses one spaceship. After losing three spaceships, the game ends.
